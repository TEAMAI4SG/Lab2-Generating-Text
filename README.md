# Lab 2a: Generating Text with OpenAI‚Äôs Models

---

## üìò Introduction

In this lab, we delve into the fascinating world of AI-driven text generation using OpenAI's advanced models. The rapid evolution of AI technologies has made it possible to generate coherent, contextually relevant, and often insightful text completions and responses. This technology is not just a cornerstone of modern natural language processing (NLP) but is also reshaping how we interact with machines, creating new possibilities in various fields like journalism, creative writing, programming, and more.

By the end of this lab, you will be equipped with the practical skills to harness the power of AI in generating text, which is a critical skill in the evolving landscape of business and technology.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Make a copy** of the [Text Completions Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1A70EtOMPj8IKoXW_7URsWuXFDc4fho0E?usp=sharing)

2. To set up your development environment, you will need to install the OpenAI Python library, which we will use to generate text in this lab. You can run the following shell scripts, which are also **pre-written** in the first cell of your Colab notebook, to do so.

```Python
# Uninstall Colab's preinstalled modules which have dependency conflicts with OpenAI
!pip uninstall tensorflow-probability -y 
!pip uninstall llmx -y 

# Install the OpenAI Python library
!pip install --upgrade openai
```

3. Now, locate your OpenAI API key that you have saved in Lab 1. You may already have one from a previous lab; if not, please refer to Lab 1 for instructions. If you cannot find your API key anymore, you may need to create a new one [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

## üì• Importing and Initializing OpenAI

1. Now that you have the OpenAI Python library installed, we can begin to code. At the top of your cell, import OpenAI.

```Python
from openai import OpenAI
```

2. Next, initialize an OpenAI object. This will allow you to use the OpenAI API to communicate with OpenAI‚Äôs models. Make sure to **replace your-api-key-here** with your API key.

```Python
client = OpenAI(api_key='your-api-key-here')
```

## üí¨ Function to Generate a Response from the Model

1. Create a function titled get_completion with 2 parameters: prompt and model= "gpt-3.5-turbo" 
      - This function will prompt the specified OpenAI model with the user‚Äôs input (prompt) to generate 
        and return a desired response.

```Python
def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
```

2. The **chat.completions.create** function is a function from the OpenAI Python library which creates a model response for the given chat conversation. It has 2 required parameters: **model and messages**. 

model is specified as a string, the name of one of OpenAI‚Äôs different text generation models (i.e. gpt-4, gpt-4 turbo, gpt-3.5-turbo). Different models can be selected for different purposes.

messages is a list of message objects, which are of the form {"role": _____, "content": ___}. Each object has a **role** (either "system", "user", or "assistant") and **content**. Conversations can be as short as one message or many back and forth turns.

Use the **chat.completions.create** function inside your **get_completion** function as shown below to retrieve the desired response. 

```Python
def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"): 
   completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": ___}, 
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt},
        ]
    )
   return completion.choices[0].message.content
```

3. Fill in the blank after "content" to tell OpenAI what role to play. (In ours, we told it to "Be a couplet poet"! Other ideas might include "You are William Shakespeare.")

‚ö†Ô∏è Running the get_completion function will call the OpenAI API, which costs money. This is typically a few cents per call (depending on the model used), but it can add up, so don‚Äôt run it before you are ready.

## üéÆ Using the Function with User Input

1. Now we have a function that can give the OpenAI model a role to play, then return its response to a prompt. Let‚Äôs test it out! First, ask the user for an input and store it in a variable named **prompt**.

```Python
prompt = input("Enter a prompt: ")
```

2. Pass the input through the **get_completion** function and store it in a variable named **response**.

‚ö†Ô∏è Running the get_completion function will call the OpenAI API, which costs money. This is typically a few cents per call (depending on the model used), but it can add up, so don‚Äôt run it before you are ready.

```Python
response = get_completion(prompt)
```

3. Finally, display the response obtained from OpenAI! 

```Python
print(response)
```

4. Try playing around with different inputs and giving the model different roles and see what happens!

5. Finally, modify your code so that it can create a poem based on your prompt.

6. After you finish your lab, check your OpenAI usage [here](https://platform.openai.com/usage) to get a sense of the cost associated with the Open AI API calls. Take a screenshot of your usage, including ‚ÄúCost‚Äù and ‚ÄúActivity‚Äù
