# Lab 2a: Generating Text with OpenAI‚Äôs Models

---

## üìò Introduction

In this lab, we delve into the fascinating world of AI-driven text generation using OpenAI's advanced models. The rapid evolution of AI technologies has made it possible to generate coherent, contextually relevant, and often insightful text completions and responses. This technology is not just a cornerstone of modern natural language processing (NLP) but is also reshaping how we interact with machines, creating new possibilities in various fields like journalism, creative writing, programming, and more.

By the end of this lab, you will be equipped with the practical skills to harness the power of AI in generating text, which is a critical skill in the evolving landscape of business and technology.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Make a copy** of the [Text Completions Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1A70EtOMPj8IKoXW_7URsWuXFDc4fho0E?usp=sharing)

2. To set up your development environment, you will need to install the OpenAI Python library, which we will use to generate text in this lab. You can run the following shell scripts, which are also **pre-written** in the first cell of your Colab notebook, to do so.

```python
# Uninstall Colab's preinstalled modules which have dependency conflicts with OpenAI
!pip uninstall tensorflow-probability -y 
!pip uninstall llmx -y 

# Install the OpenAI Python library
!pip install --upgrade openai
```

3. Now, locate your OpenAI API key that you have saved in Lab 1. You may already have one from a previous lab; if not, please refer to Lab 1 for instructions. If you cannot find your API key anymore, you may need to create a new one [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
